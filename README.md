# Music Recommendation System

This repository contains code and resources for building a music recommendation system. The goal of this project is to create a system that suggests music tracks to users based on their preferences and listening history.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of user interactions with music tracks. It includes information such as user IDs, track IDs, play counts, and user ratings. The dataset can be obtained from music streaming platforms, public datasets, or APIs.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Surprise
- Flask (for creating a web-based interface, if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scikit-surprise flask jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
https://github.com/rakshana-07/LGMVIP--DataScience-TASK-03
```

2. Obtain or prepare the music interaction dataset and save it as a CSV file in the `data` directory.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository (`music_recommendation.ipynb`) to see the step-by-step process of loading the data, preprocessing it, building recommendation models, and making predictions.

4. Alternatively, you can run the provided Python script (`music_recommendation.py`) using the command:

```bash
python music_recommendation.py
```

5. If you're creating a web-based interface, navigate to the `web_interface` directory and follow the instructions provided in the `README` file.

## Results

The notebook and script will demonstrate how to train and evaluate various recommendation models. The outcome will be a set of recommended music tracks for each user, based on the chosen algorithm and user data. The web-based interface, if implemented, will allow users to interact with the recommendation system.
